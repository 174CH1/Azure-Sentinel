Enter the **1Password API Key**, and **URI**.\n - Use the following schema for the `uri` value: `https://events.1pasword.com`\n - The default **Time Interval** is set to pull the last five (5) minutes of data. If the time interval needs to be modified, it is recommended to change the Function App Timer Trigger accordingly (in the function.json file, post deployment) to prevent overlapping data ingestion.\n - The default **Log Types** is set to pull all 6 available log types (`alert, page, application, audit, infrastructure, network`), remove any are not required. \n - \n4. Mark the checkbox labeled **I agree to the terms and conditions stated above**. \n5. Click **Purchase** to deploy.\n6.
