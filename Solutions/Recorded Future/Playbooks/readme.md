# Recorded Future Intelligence for Microsoft Sentinel

## Prerequisites  

### Solution Dependecies 

The **Threat Intelligence** solution from Microsoft Sentinel Content Hub must be installed for indicators to be forwarded to Microsoft Sentinel ThreatIntelligenceIndicator log table. The Threat Intelligence Solution contains both the deprecated **Threat Intelligence Platforms Data Connector** and the new **Threat Intelligence Upload Indicators API**.

### Roles and Permissions

Microsoft article that describes roles and permissions in Microsoft Sentinel [Roles and permissions in Microsoft Sentinel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sentinel/roles).

During installation, permissions are required on the resource group level to use and authorize the playbooks. [Microsoft Sentinel Contributor](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#microsoft-sentinel-contributor) and [Logic App Contributor](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#logic-app-contributor).

Alternative use [managed identity](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview) authorization for playbook. The user performing the installation needs to have the role of **Owner** or **Role Based Access Control Administrator** on resource group level.

### Connectors Authorization 
Each connector need to be authorized after playbook/logic app installation. Expand all nodes in the logic app after installation and look for blocks marked with a warning sign. Open and authorize all connections.

Recorded Future requires API keys to communicate with our API. To obtain API keys. [Start a 30-day free trial of Recorded Future for Microsoft Sentinel from here!](https://go.recordedfuture.com/microsoft-azure-sentinel-free-trial?utm_campaign=&utm_source=microsoft&utm_medium=gta) or visit [Recorded Future Requesting API Tokens](https://support.recordedfuture.com/hc/en-us/articles/4411077373587-Requesting-API-Tokens) (Require Recorded Future Login) and request API token for ```Recorded Future for Microsoft Sentinel``` or/and ```Recorded Future Sandbox for Microsoft Sentinel```.

The Recorded Future solution uses the following connectors:
- **/recordedfuturev2** - [Microsoft power platform connector](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/connectors/recordedfuturev2/). 

- **/RecordedFuture-CustomConnector** - [RecordedFuture-CustomConnector](Connectors/RecordedFuture-CustomConnector/readme.md)

- **/recordedfuturesandbo** - [Microsoft power platform connector](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/connectors/recordedfuturesandbo/).

- **/azuresentinel** - [Documentation on Microsoft power platform connectors](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/connectors/azuresentinel/)

- **/microsoftgraphsecurity** - [Documenation on Microsoft power platform connectors](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/connectors/microsoftgraphsecurity/). The playbooks using this API is being DEPRECATED and will transition to new playbooks using /azuresentinel api.

## Ingestion and Operational costs
Playbook(Logic apps) may result in additional ingestion or operational costs:

1. [Usage metering, billing, and pricing for Azure Logic Apps](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/logic-apps/logic-apps-pricing)

1. [Azure Monitor Logs cost calculations and options](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/cost-logs)

Recorded Futures risk lists are generated at different cadences as described in this support article [Risk List Download Recommendations](https://support.recordedfuture.com/hc/en-us/articles/115010401968-Risk-List-Download-Recommendations) (Require Recorded Future Login). It is possible to adjust cadence to decrease cost of data processing.

# Installation

There are two options for installing playbooks and starting automate threat response:

1. Installing the solution inside Microsoft Sentinel Content Hub. (Recommended)

2. It's possible to install some of the playbooks one by one by directly from this Readme further down.

## 1. Content Hub Installation

1. Locate the `Recorded Future Intelligence Solution` in Microsoft Sentinel Content Hub.
![](Images/2023-04-18-08-39-58.png)
1. Press **Install**  and continue to configure the solution. 

1. If the installation was completed successfully, you will now have Workbook templates, Automation Playbook templates and Analytic Rules templates.

Note that the solution  install templates and you have to use the templates to install workbooks, playbooks and analytic rules. 
![](Images/2023-11-20-12-13-25.png)

When installing playbooks from templates, read the description and look for dependencies that have to be installed. Example, install a custom connector that is included in the solution together with the playbook.

## 2. Individual Playbook installation
To install individual playbooks, use the buttons next to the descriptions of the [Playbooks [further down in this document](#Playbooks).

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> **Due to internal dependencies, always deploy and activate the ThreatIntelligenceImport playbook before any of the \*-IndicatorImport playbooks.**

# Playbooks
All playbooks are not included in the Content Hub Solution. It is stated in the description of each playbook as 'Included in Solution: Yes/No'. Some of the playbooks are provided as previews or examples of how to automate use cases. Â  

Playbooks in subfolders:
- [Enrichment Playbooks](Enrichment/readme.md)
- [Indicator Import/Risk List Playbooks](IndicatorImport/readme.md)
- [Alert Playbooks](Alerts/readme.md)
- [Sandbox Playbooks](./Sandboxing/readme.md)
- [Threat Hunt Playbooks](./ThreatHunting/readme.md)
- [Custom Connector](./Connectors/RecordedFuture-CustomConnector/readme.md)
- [Deprecated Risk List Playbooks](Deprecated/readme.md)



# Workboooks

# Analytic Rules


# Upgrade from previous versions
Information about latest released version number can be found in Recorded Future Intelligence Solution [release notes](../ReleaseNotes.md). There can be delay to the version available inside the content hub and whats in listed here due to publish/rollout time.  

### From version 2.4
We are deprecating the RecordedFuture-ImportToSentinel and all *-TIProcessor playbooks. Going forward, install the new IndicatorImport playbooks and configure them to download you selection of risk lists. Use the same risk lists being downloaded today, same cadence, and use the same description using the TIProcessor playbooks. Use the same description for threat indicators if you have analytic rules set up for alerting. 

Our support will end when Microsoft shut down the underlying API. More information can be found on [Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sentinel/understand-threat-intelligence#add-threat-indicators-to-microsoft-sentinel-with-the-threat-intelligence-platforms-data-connector) (No end date has communicated from Microsoft at this point November 2023).

### From version 1
If you have a version 1 installation you need to first acquire a V2 APi key from Recorded Future. Install the new all IndicatorImport and enrichment -playbooks. Select a different name than the once already installed and reauthenticate them. Configure the IndicatorImport playbooks to pull your selection of risk lists. After validating that the new playbooks works as expected you can deactivate the V1 versions. 

# Troubleshooting

## Query Risk Lists
After successfully running and importing one or more Risk Lists it is possible to query the imported data in your Log Analytics Workspace. 

Example queries:  
``` sql 
//  List 10 rows from ThreatIntelligenceIndicator log imported from Recorded Future
ThreatIntelligenceIndicator
| where Description contains "Recorded Future"
| take 10

// List 10 rows from ThreatIntelligenceIndicator log imported from the  
// IP - Actively Communicating C&C Server Risk List 
ThreatIntelligenceIndicator
|where Description == "Recorded Future - IP - Actively Communicating C&C Server"
| take 10

//  List 10 rows from ThreatIntelligenceIndicator log imported from Recorded Future
ThreatIntelligenceIndicator
|where Description == "Recorded Future - IP - Actively Communicating C&C Server" and AdditionalInformation contains "Cobalt Strike"
| take 10
```

### Report isses/errors

When reporting issues or errors to Recorded Future on logic apps. Please include logic app version identifier that can be found in the version section in the azure portal.

# Known Issues 
## Version 3.0
Microsoft Sentinel playbook upgrade experience can result in the following error: ```Cannot read properties of null (reading 'parameters')```
![](Images/2023-09-13-19-16-24.png)

A workaround is to reinstall and overwrite the playbooks from the template in Playbook Template tab and not using the upgrade wizard. Before overwriting an active playbook make note of the risk list downloaded, the description, cadence of downloading.
