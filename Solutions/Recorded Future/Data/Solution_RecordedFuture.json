  "Description": "[Recorded Future](https://www.recordedfuture.com/) is the worlds largest provider of intelligence for enterprise security. By combining persistent and pervasive automated data collection and analytics with human analysis, Recorded Future delivers intelligence that is timely, accurate, and actionable.\n\nPlaybooks have internal dependencies to RecordedFuture-ImportToSentinel so install the RecordedFuture-ImportToSentinel playbook before any of the others. \n \n \nThis solution takes a dependency on functionality like Azure Logic Apps, Azure Monitor Logs. Some of these dependencies might result in additional ingestion or operational costs.\n\n* https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/workspace-design \n* https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/logic-apps/ \n* https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sentinel/work-with-threat-indicators \n",
