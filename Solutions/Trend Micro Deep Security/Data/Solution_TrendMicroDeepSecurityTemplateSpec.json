  "Description": "The [Trend Micro Deep Security](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/business/products/hybrid-cloud/deep-security.html) solution for Microsoft Sentinel enables you to ingest Deep Security logs into Microsoft Sentinel, using the Common Event Format (CEF) for Security Monitoring.\r\n  \r\n  **Underlying Microsoft Technologies used:** \r\n\r\n This solution takes a dependency on the following technologies, and some of these dependencies either may be in [Preview](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/) state or might result in additional ingestion or operational costs:\r\n\n  a. [Agent-based log collection (CEF over Syslog)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sentinel/connect-common-event-format)\r\n\n This solution is dependent on the Common Event Format solution containing the CEF via AMA connector to collect the logs. The CEF solution will be installed as part of this solution installation. \n\n**NOTE:** Microsoft recommends installation of CEF via AMA Connector. Legacy connector uses the Log Analytics agent which is about to be deprecated by **Aug 31, 2024,** and thus should only be installed where AMA is not supported. Using MMA and AMA on same machine can cause log duplication and extra ingestion cost [more details](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sentinel/ama-migrate).",
