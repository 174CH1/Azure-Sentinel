  "Description": "The [FireEye Network Security (NX)](https://www.fireeye.com/products/network-security.html) solution provides the capability to ingest FireEye Network Security logs into Microsoft Sentinel.\n\r\n1. **FireEye Network Security via AMA** - This data connector helps in ingesting FireEye Network Security logs into your Log Analytics Workspace using the new Azure Monitor Agent. Learn more about ingesting using the new Azure Monitor Agent [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/sentinel/connect-cef-ama). **Microsoft recommends using this Data Connector**.\n\r\n2. **FireEye Network Security via Legacy Agent** - This data connector helps in ingesting FireEye Network Security logs into your Log Analytics Workspace using the legacy Log Analytics agent.\n\nThis solution is dependent on the Common Event Format solution containing the CEF via AMA connector to collect the logs. The CEF solution will be installed as part of this solution installation.\n\n**NOTE:** Microsoft recommends installation of CEF via AMA Connector. The existing connectors are about to be deprecated by Aug 31, 2024.",
